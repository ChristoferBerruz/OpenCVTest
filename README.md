# OpenCVTest
Windows Application to illustrate the Canny Edge Detection and the Harris Corner Detection algorithm using the emguCV library.

Currently, the Harris Detector outputs the Harris response; I am working on filtering and linking coordinates above a certain
treshold for better visualization. However, in the Harris response, it is clear that the corners are well defined.

Due to the lack of updated posts on how to use emguCV, please use this code as reference in your projects!
